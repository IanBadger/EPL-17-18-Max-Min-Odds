Dumbell charts for the EPL 2017/2018 season

Following on from my dumbbell charts of maximum and minimum odds in the 2017/2018 Championship season, I chose to apply to same analysis to the 2017/2018 EPL season. Again, the data came from www.football-data.co.uk and visualisation were created in R using ggplot2 and ggalt. The new colour palette for the EPL is widely available hence the garish colours! The first dumbbell chart sorted the teams in their final league positions.

The first reaction is this chart looks different to the championship charts. There are fewer fluctuations with the minimum odds generally following the final positions. There are two clubs that immediately stand out here: Burnley and Huddersfield, both of whom might’ve been expected to finish in the bottom three if the bookies were to be believed but both outperformed their odds. Southampton on the contrary look to have underperformed, finishing lower down the table then the odds expected. 
The teams were again reordered per the minimum average odds with actual finishing positions shown in brackets.

As could might have been guessed from the first chart, the minimum odds and final positions are closely aligned. Southampton’s poor performance again jumps out, there is not a lot of interest until the over performance of Burnley and Huddersfield at the bottom of the chart. The final point of interest produced by this chart is the separation of the “big 6” from the rest of the league.
